## Toronto-clustering-exercise

The Toronto exercise was part of some course work I've done. The primary point was to demonstrate functions in various libaries to pull data from the internet, analyze it, then chart it to a map.
Python libraries used: pandas, json, geopy, beautiful soup, sklearn, matplotlib, folium

General Notes:  
 * Jupyter Notebooks are best viewed in Chrome. Some folium maps do not render correctly in browsers like IE
 * GitHub has issues rendering Juptyer Notebooks consistantly (issue 3035):   
   Workaround URL (copy URL to notebook into site): https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
 * Folium maps do not display in GitHub. Screenshots have been attached, but maps should display in the link above.
