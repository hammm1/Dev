This repository is primarily to display various Python projects I've worked on. 

General Notes:  
 * Jupyter Notebooks are best viewed in Chrome. Some folium maps do not render correctly in browsers like IE
 * GitHub has issues rendering Juptyer Notebooks consistantly (issue 3035):   
   Workaround URL (copy URL to notebook into site): https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
 * Folium maps do not display in GitHub. Screenshots have been attached, but maps should display in the link above.
